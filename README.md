# wikipedia-dark

Just a quick reference guide to setup wikipedia with a dark theme

1) Create an account (all usernames start with capital letter)
2) go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering
3) Click on "Custom CSS" next to Vector theme area
4) In this repo copy the dark css file. If on macOS run below command to do that easily
`cat vector_dark.css | pbcopy`
5) Paste theme into wikipedia & save


## Notes
- instructions based on https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector-DarkCSS
- theme is not perfect, its a few years old and was designed for more generic wiki
  -- wikipedia has been updated, need to update theme but cannot find original LESS source code for theme
